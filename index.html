       <h2> About </h2>
        <p> As a Bengali Muslim, I wanted to see how our community is at the current state. The idea was
            to see the mosque locations and compare it with the density of Muslim population in nyc, mainly 
            by borough.At first it was a very simple idea, however it was much more tricky than I had anticipated.
            The hurdle that was the most difficult through this entire project was the dataset itself. Not because it
            was a large dataset, its actually the opposite. Dare I say, a <strong>non-existent</strong> dataset. More on 
            that down below.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Sections">
        <h2> The Data </h2>
         <p> The first dataset that I worked with was various locations of Mosques throughout New York. It was not too 
             big but it does have a lot of locations we do not need:
         </p>
         <div class = "container">
            <img src="images/MosqueLoc.png" alt="NYS Mosque Locations">
         </div>
         <p>
             To have more accurate data, I want to only have nyc Mosques, and the key identifier to distinguish what
             is nyc and what is outside is with the zipcode. I obtained all the nyc zipcodes and have it as a new dataframe:
         </p>
         <div class = "container2">
            <img src="images/NYCZipcodes.png" alt="NYC Zipcodes">
         </div>
         <p>
             Now that I have only nyc zipcodes, I can clean the dataset with join SQL Query using PandaSQL. After cleaning
             the data up, I now have the locations of Mosques in Nyc: 
         </p>
         <div class = "container">
            <img src="images/CleanedMosqueLoc.png" alt="NYC Mosques">
         </div>
         <p>
            This is where the hardest part of the project came, <strong> I could not find any dataset for population.</strong>
            I searched for days and days, finding nothing substantial to work with. I wanted to get the Muslim population by Borough,
            but nothing came up, and I realized why. That kind of information is potentially <strong>dangerous</strong>. Especially
            with so much hate crimes throughout the year, I should have realized it was so difficult.
         </p> 
         <p>
            So I decided on narrowing my search,by using the population of Bangladeshi people who live in NY. The reason for this is because I am a Bangladeshi Muslim and about 90% of 
            the population are muslim. Also, many who do move tend to look for areas that are have Mosques nearby because it is a necessity of prayer. 
            With that said, it was still near impossible to find, but I had something I was able to work with:

         </div>
         <p>
            Thanks to the Asian American Federation, I was able to atleast have some data to use. If had more information, 
            I would not have been so constraint on how to use them, but sometimes you just have to work 
            with what you have.

        <h2> Techniques And Outputs </h2>
         <p> 
             Now that I have data, I can start making the map I wanted to display. The libraries I used are Pandas,
             Numpy, PandaSQL, Folium, geopy and Geopandas. As we saw earlier, we used pandas and pandaSQL to to clean the data. Before 
             I can place the the mosques on the map using folium, I need to be able to get the coordinates of each one. To achieve this, 
             I used geopy and Nominatim, an API that once you pass addresses as an input, it will return an object with latitude and
             longitude properties. I store them one by one to a csv file, which will be used to plot in the folium map. 
         </p>
         <p>
             I saved them into a csv file but it was difficult to work with, because sometimes I get Nan as an output, the coordinates can be
             wrong and you are only able to have one API call per second, so it was very time consuming. Once I have obtained all the coordinates, I am able to
             start plotting in folium!
         </p>
         <div class = "container4">
            <img src="images/CleanMap.png" alt="Clean Map">
         </div>
         <p>
            Folium have markers and after passing in the latitude and longitude, you are able to display all the mosques in the scattered
            throughout nyc: 
        </p>
        <div class = "container4">
            <img src="images/MarkedMap.png" alt="Clean Map">
         </div>
         <p>
             Looking at this data we can make a guess that majority of the population would be hovering around brooklyn, but to really see it, 
             I will overlay a bound for each borough:
         </p>
         <div class = "container4">
            <img src="images/BorderedMap.png" alt="Clean Map">
         </div>
         <p>
             Now we can really see that they are grouped up in brooklyn. The borders are made using the nybb dataset. It contains a bunch of points to
             form a polygon that will eventually make up each border. 
         </p>
         <p>
             Now They are set up, we can now account the Bengali Population into each border as a Choropleth Map and visually see 
             how the population compare to the number of Mosques in each Borough:
         </p>
